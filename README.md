# Statistics and probability - Project 3 Moving Average

This project involves enhancing an Android app that fetches historical currency exchange rates from the ExchangeRate API. The app will display these rates in a line chart and calculate moving averages (SMA) using a user-defined window size. Users can configure settings such as start and end dates, currency, and SMA window size via a UI. The app must support multiple SMA lines displayed simultaneously, allowing users to add or remove them dynamically. All features include robust error handling and intuitive design.
